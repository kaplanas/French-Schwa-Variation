## About
This project explored variation in the production of schwa in the [PFC corpus of spoken French](http://www.projet-pfc.net/).  We demonstrated that there are inter-speaker differences in how likely schwa is to appear in various contexts, over and above dialect variation.  For a full description, see our [Glossa 2016 paper](http://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/10.5334/gjgl.54/).

## Dependencies
+ `lme4`

## Usage
To run the code,

1. Download all the .R and .csv files and put them in the same directory.
2. Run `schwa_pfc_analysis.R`.

R will generate .ps files corresponding to all of the graphs that appear in our [paper](http://www.glossa-journal.org/articles/10.5334/gjgl.54/).
